Hello GitHub!

Firstly and forthrightly, my name is Steve! I am an alum of the University of New Hampshire, with a B.S. in Environmental Conservation and Sustainability. Don't let that fool you -- that's not all I'm about! I have a wide variety of interests in various fields, combining the concepts is quite a lot of fun. I am looking forward to learning more on this platform from everyone, and hope I can teach some things too.
